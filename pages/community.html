        <p> Do you have a favorite Minion or Card? Do you have a vision of what your homunculus does when it’s not bending the elements to your will? If you do, and you are artistically minded, why don’t you show us?  We accept submissions of all kinds - art, music, writing, cosplay, etc.  Basically, if you make it, we want to see it!</p>
        <p>Send submissions to contact@foreverinteractive.com and we'll review the content and share it with the community!</p>
