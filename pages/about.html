        <p>The Afterlife is at stake, and only those who pursue the Visions of Zosimos can hope to save it.</p> 

		<p>In the 16th century, a mystic known as Zosimos the Moravian recorded his visions and alchemical insights in a series of manuscripts that hearken back to the original manuscripts from 300 AD written by Zosimos of Panopolis.  At the time, his writings were not widely accepted because of their heretical nature, and most copies were destroyed or lost to time.  Recently, surviving copies were were brought to light by Bertold Slate, a Professor of 16th century studies.</p>
        
        <p>After reading through the Visions Manuscripts, Slate realized that he had to share what he had learned or be damned to see the world slowly be drawn deeper and deeper into chaos. He saw signs of darkness everywhere and his words of caution soon began to attract the attention of other like minded scholars and modern mystics.  Things truly changed when he shared the Visions with a friend who was a Computer Science professor. Together they began to create a program that could express the complex formulae of the arcane texts in the language of computers, gathering select programmers and theologians to create an interface for this mystical learning.  This ‘game’ is that interface, allowing novices to be inducted into an eternal struggle for the very nature of existence, for the Visions are not only teachings in Alchemy and Mysticism but they are also a dire  warning for our very souls.</p>
        
        <p>When you begin to play, you become a student of the Visions.  Students create their own homunculus that will represent them in battles.  The homunculus and cards are manifestations of power generated by the arcane mathematical coding of the Visions Program. The player becomes empowered with the addition of cards which are earned through exploration, victory, or purchase. These are tools for mastering the maps and adversaries in the great struggle, they allow the initiated to travel the path towards triumph, desolation, and even immortality.</p> 

		<p>Realms - There is an eternal struggle between the Light and the Dark.  In the middle of that struggle is the Void, a pestilence that takes root and subverts, corrupts, and alters the traditional architectures of arcane power.  There is a tendency to think that the Dark is a natural ally of the Void, but that is not so.  Instead, the Dark is motivated by powerful negative emotions and is only interested in its own glory and gain.  As for the Light, they fight for enlightenment and seek to create an order based on the abolishment of Darkness.  One should also keep in mind that the classic notion of Light as Goodness and Dark as Evil is not always so- everything in the afterlife is not black and white.</p>
        
        <p>   Into this mix, we must consider the Elements; the core of which are Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Each has facets that reflect Light or Darkness, each has parts that when combined can create more powerful Elements, such as Ice and Lightning.  Each Element has its own properties and presents interesting conduits of power for the initiated who can wield them. </p>
        
         <p>And so the Elements are in flux and the battle rages on.  Yet, through it all, there is one force not yet mentioned: the Grey, the Fulcrum.  Neutral and impartial, the Fulcrum is the stuff that makes up the spaces between, that connects light and dark and eases the transition.  While the Void is a nothingness that consumes and takes over, the Fulcrum is an everything, the Force that binds Creation and the Afterlife together in Harmony.</p>  
         
         <p>A new Student entering the Afterlife for the first time should understand the ideas and backgrounds of the Light and Dark Realms followers. Most of the people you will meet in the afterlife are ones who grew up being taught what was inherently right and wrong from their parents. The idea of good and evil has almost become instinctual in the Afterlife when to an outsider, you will realize it is not so black and white as we stated before.</p>
         
         <p>When it comes down to it, both Light and Dark are after the same thing. Abolishing the opposing Realm and the Void. Their homunculi and decks differ greatly but each are used to defeat their enemies. Their definitions of the Greater Good are essentially the same so good and evil does not truly exist. This is one reason why the Fulcrum has yet to pick a side. </p>
