        	<h3>Founder Store: FAQ's</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
        	<h3>Can I purchase if I am outside of the United States?</h3>
            <p>Yes, however, understand that we are a small team with little funding at this time. As such, we do not have plans to localize VoZ to formats external to the United States at this time. While this may change in the future, if you cannot read English, then please understand that you may not get a version of VoZ that is in your native language.</p>
            <p>Founder Store will be able accept payment from <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide" target="_blank">Click Here</a>
            
            <h3>Will there be formats other than PC/Windows?</h3>
            <p>Due to the contracts and constraints of the Hero Engine and our current financial situation, we cannot afford to obtain source code access to the Hero Engine. While this may change in the future, at this time, we only plan to release VoZ on Windows/PC machines.</p>
            
            <h3>Where can I go to discuss/share my idea(s)?</h3>
            <p>We at FI practice Open Door, Agile Software Development and attempt to get early customer engagement at every possible moment. As such, we love to hear questions, comments, concerns, criticism, etc... from the community. You may share any of this with us at our email: <a href="#/contact" target="_blank">contact@foreverinteractive.com</a> or our <a href="forums.visionsofzosimos.net" target="_blank">forums</a></p>
            
            <h3>Will VoZ be on Steam?</h3>
            <p>This is a good question, and for right now, we honestly do not know. There are a lot of constraints with Hero Engine and how it relates to microtransactions, payments, client based downloads, etc... For obvious reasons we are actively working on resolutions to this with the hopes that upon our launch, we will be able to utilize Steam as a partner.</p>
            
            <h3>Does VoZ have <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr>?</h3>
            <p>Due to the inherent nature of the game, it requires a persistent internet connection to be able to play. When the game launches in gold status, despite the fact that it will have PvE, it will still require an internet connection. This is not due to <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> in the strictest sense, but rather the fact that VoZ harnesses MMO features as part of gameplay. However, considering that VoZ requires an internet connection, people may consider this a form of <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr>.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a digital starter pack</h3>
            <p>We have been getting this question a lot lately, so we decided to add it to our FAQâ€™s as well.Our Digital Starter Pack is essentially the same as a theme pack in Magic The Gathering. Each digital starter pack contains a pre-built themed, competitive 60 card deck which you can play straight out of the box or customize with your existing card collection. This deck guarantees you one Epic card! This is a great entry level deck to get you into the world of Visions of Zosimos and playing right away!</p>
            
            <h3>When will I receive my backer rewards?</h3>
            <p>Digital backer rewards will be sent to you via email upon the release of the full game.</p>
            
            <p>All other rewards will be distributed between successful completion of your purchase and the release of the full game. For further questions, please contact us at <a href="#/contact" target="_blank">contact@foreverinteractive.com</a></p>
