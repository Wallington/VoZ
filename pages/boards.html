        <p>Currently used as our premiere PVP arena, The Cathedral of Bones is a place where the fallen angels known as the Grigori used to fight and train. Now, only the Grigori Outcast remains and he is Lord of this Arena.  Silently watching from his throne, he may look dispassionate, but beware his wrath if he decides to join your battle! </p>

			<p> In the Visions of Zosimos, some allusions were made to places within the Afterlife, and one of those places was the Blighted Mire.  In this swampy forest, youâ€™ll find the half-sunken relics of a former civilization, guarded by twisted, warped beings who used to be bright and beautiful.  Tied now to this section of the Afterlife, there is an ever-renewing battle between the bog and the Students of the Visions, who seek to one day clear the tainted memories from this place.</p>
