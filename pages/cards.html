        <p>The powers that  you wield in battle are based on the principles of alchemical creation.  The three building blocks of the Homunculus are reflected in Materia Cards known as Construct, Essence, and Memories.  These cards add to the power and functionality of your Homunculus.</p>

			<p>Terrain cards are some of the most dynamic of the cards available. They can be played each turn, but can also be destroyed to harness the power of the element which they represent. This power gives the Homunculus a boost of energy, and once the energy is expelled it cannot be used again. </p>

        <p>Ambush cards use Soul dice to be played, and while they require some of the most concentration and skill to perform, even Students without a streak of Machiavelli in them can learn to wield these cards to their advantage. Ambush cards activate based on changes in their immediate vicinity, which means cards placed underneath the enemy will not trigger until another physical being enters that hex.  Some Ambush Cards can be triggered by events within a certain radius, while others rely on your still of anticipating your target’s moving into a specific hex.  From a mystical standpoint, the Essence of your Homunculus imbues these cards with the collected energies of some of the greatests strategists from history, so you can rely on their guidance while you fight in the Afterlife.</p>

			<p>Glyph cards can require a serious amount of concentration and skill to be played, not because they are hidden but because they are physical like Minions and transparent like terrain. They can be targeted by Minions, Wandering Monsters and Homunculi but do not occupy space on the board. A glyph can not be placed on a glyph. Glyphs resemble Ambushes  in the sense that they can affect multiple tiles surrounding it. In a sense they act as a beacon or a stationary Enchantment producer, but unlike Enchantments, the effect is only temporary and will disappear after a short time.</p>

        <p>The students in the Afterlife do not call upon demons or spiritual forces to perform spells for them, instead their Homunculus taps into the power of its mind to take the card from the deck and unleash its effects upon the target. Spell cards are used to target far away tiles and enemy creatures to keep the enemy at bay as well as on its toes. The Memory aspect of the  homunculus channels the innate energy within the Spell card and directs it towards your target.  As such, all Spells will use Mind dice to be played.</p>

			<p>The Enchantments work similar to the Spells in that they use Mind dice to be played, but their focus is less on general havoc and more on altering a specific target or group of targets.  Remember that an enchantment is not always an enhancement; it simply means that a change is underway, which is not always beneficial for the target. The Enchantment Card melds with the target to enhance or break down their physical being.  Many enchantments focus on allowing your Homunculus or minions to be positively augmented but there are also plenty of Enchantments to be used to negatively affect an enemy Homunculus, Minion, or even Monsters.</p>

        <p>Minion Cards are summoned to the battlefield using the Body Dice of the Homunculus. These cards create sentient beings in the Afterlife. Think of playing these cards as your Homunculus extending its own physical presence into the new minion.  As such, the transmutation of its Body into the new being can only occur on an adjacent hex.</p>

			<p>Boss Cards represent the monsters and presences that you will face in the Afterlife. When you defeat a boss in battle, there is a chance that their card will drop, so if you’re lucky, these powerful adversaries can be brought into your own army. The Boss Card is a reflection of what you have faced, and is certain to be a powerful addition to any deck.</p>
