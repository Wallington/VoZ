        <p>The powers that you wield in battle are based on the principles of alchemical creation. The three building blocks of the <strong>Homunculus</strong> are reflected in <strong>Materia Cards</strong> known as <strong>Construct</strong>, <strong>Essence</strong>, and <strong>Memories</strong>. These cards add to the power and functionality of your Homunculus.</p>
       <p><strong>Behemoth</strong>- The great beast <strong>Behemoth</strong> was described by Job as a great, powerful and gentle beast. His bones are as strong as pieces of brass and are like bars of iron. The <strong>Light Realm</strong> took the opportunity and retrieved the fallen beasts’ bones and have being using it as <strong>Construct Materials</strong>.  The <strong>Behemoth</strong> lives on in the form of the <strong>Homunculus</strong> and it shows in the way it acts in the battlefield. It’s strong legs propel the <strong>Behemoth</strong> and the added momentum pushes back any creature that gets in its way.</p><img class="pull-right cardArt" src="images/materiaCardArt/Materia_Vladimir-_The-Impaler_-Tepes.png" alt="Vladimir-_The-Impaler art" /> 
       <p><strong>Vladimir "The Impaler" Tepes</strong>-  <strong>Vladimir Tepes</strong> was a member of House of Drăculești and became the inspiration to what we now know as Dracula. <strong>Vlad</strong> was the Prince of Wallachia and considered a folk hero in Romania. He battled with the Ottoman Empire, claimed a victory against them after a surprise attack at Hamza Bey, and was given the nickname of <strong>“the Impaler”</strong> for how he impaled his enemies and even some of his own troops to cause fear in the opposing forces. The<strong> Essence of Vlad the Impaler </strong>allowing the <strong>Homunculus</strong> to sacrifice a <strong>Minion</strong> to become a <strong>Glyph</strong> on the battlefield.</p>
       <p><strong>Saint Albertus Magnus</strong>- <strong>Saint Albertus Magnus</strong> or <strong>Albert the Great is a Catholic Saint</strong> and is known as the Doctor of the Church.  After his death, his work as an <strong>Alchemist</strong> became more and more apparent, the works that surfaced spoke of how he mastered the art of alchemy and the power of stones. In his alchemical works, he is credited with discovering the Philosopher’s Stone and those works keep his <strong>Memories</strong> alive, allowing for the easy discovery of <strong>Ambushes</strong> placed by his opponents.</p>

			<p><strong>Terrain Cards</strong> are some of the most dynamic of the cards available. They can be played each turn, but can also be destroyed to harness the power of the element which they represent. This power gives the <strong>Homunculus</strong> a boost of energy, and once the energy is expelled it cannot be used again.</p>
			<img class="pull-left cardArt" src="images/cardArt/Eden.png" alt="Eden card art" /><p><strong>Red Twins</strong>- Think of the Red Twins as a mountain range but with volcanoes. The Red Twins has chain three which means that it creates the same card adjacent to itself in any spot you choose three times! Whatever opponent steps on this card will take 1 direct <strong>Astral</strong> damage making this the perfect, offensive and defensive card.</p>
            <p><strong>Eden</strong>- Eden is a powerful <strong>Terrain Card</strong> that grants the allied unit regenerative abilities. When standing on it, during the <strong>Upkeep Phase</strong> the unit will gain one life point back and will do see each turn until it reaches its max.</p>

        <img src="images/about/ambush_banner.png" class=" pull-left img-rounded">
        <p><strong>Ambush Cards</strong> use <strong>Soul Dice</strong> to be played, and while they require some of the most concentration and skill to perform, even <strong>Students</strong> without a streak of Machiavelli in them can learn to wield these cards to their advantage. <strong>Ambush Cards</strong> activate based on changes in their immediate vicinity, which means cards placed underneath the enemy will not trigger until another physical being enters that hex. Some <strong>Ambush Cards</strong> can be triggered by events within a certain radius, while others rely on your still of anticipating your target’s moving into a specific hex. From a mystical standpoint, the <strong>Essence</strong> of your <strong>Homunculus</strong> imbues these cards with the collected energies of some of the greatests strategists from history, so you can rely on their guidance while you fight in the <strong>Afterlife</strong>.</p>
        <img class="pull-right cardArt" src="images/cardArt/Earthquake.png" alt="Earthquake card art" /><p><strong>Born in Battle</strong>- <strong>Born in Battle</strong> is one of the strongest <strong>Dark Fire Ambushes</strong> in the game costing at a whomping 7 Attack Dice! This <strong>Ambush</strong> destroys any enemy <strong>Minion</strong> that steps on it instantly. Not only that but it summons a <strong>HellSpawn</strong> in its place for you to control. It’s a Win-Win!</p>

            <p><strong>Glyph cards</strong> can require a serious amount of concentration and skill to be played, not because they are hidden but because they are <strong>physical</strong> like <strong>Minions</strong> and transparent like <strong>terrain</strong>. They can be targeted by <strong>Minions</strong>, <strong>Wandering Monsters</strong> and <strong>Homunculi</strong>but do not occupy space on the board. A <strong>Glyph</strong> can not be placed on a <strong>Glyph</strong>. <strong>Glyphs</strong> resemble <strong>Ambushes</strong> in the sense that they can affect multiple tiles surrounding it. In a sense they act as a beacon or a stationary <strong>Enchantment</strong> producer, but unlike <strong>Enchantments</strong>, the effect is only temporary and will disappear after a short time.
</p>		<img class="pull-left cardArt" src="images/cardArt/Ring of fire.png" alt="Ring of fire card art" />
			<p><strong>Duel</strong>- This <strong>Light Earth Glyph</strong> has a lot of utility and newer players may not understand its effectiveness. When enemies are within radius 2 of the <strong>Glyph</strong>, they can only target the <strong>Homunculus</strong>. Although the idea of the game is to keep your <strong>Homunculus</strong> alive this may be counter productive but in fact it can prevent attacks altogether. Using <strong>Minions</strong> to shield your <strong>Homunculus</strong> can effectively negate any attacks to you and your <strong>Minions</strong>!</p>		
           <p><strong>Ring Of Fire</strong>- This <strong>Dark Fire Glyph</strong> not only has a <strong>Knockback</strong> of two tiles but will damage your opponents for 2 damage. It literally sends a pulsing ring of fire hitting enemies within radius 2. This card provides great board control and offensive and defensive capabilities.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Students</strong> in the <strong>Afterlife</strong> do not call upon demons or spiritual forces to perform <strong>Spells</strong> for them, instead their <strong>Homunculus</strong> taps into the power of its mind to take the card from the deck and unleash its effects upon the target. <strong>Spell Cards</strong> are used to target far away tiles and enemy creatures to keep the enemy at bay as well as on its toes. The <strong>Memory</strong> aspect of the homunculus channels the innate energy within the <strong>Spell Card</strong> and directs it towards your target. As such, all <strong>Spells</strong> will use <strong>Mind Dice</strong> to be played.</p>
        <img class="pull-right cardArt" src="images/cardArt/HonorThyDead.png" alt="HonorThyDead card art" />
        <p><strong>Controlled Burn</strong>- This <strong>Dark Fire Spell</strong> will encase the board in flames and deal three spell damage to all <strong>Minions</strong> on the board. That includes your own so you may want to use this card when you are being bombarded with <strong>Minions</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Honor Thy Dead</strong>- This <strong>Light Earth Spell</strong> is used to buy you some extra time if you are being flooded with <strong>Minions</strong> or <strong>Wandering Monsters</strong>. <strong>Honor Thy Dead</strong> skips each teams Attack Phase effectively delaying what could have been your last turn!</p>

			<p>The <strong>Enchantments</strong> work similar to the <strong>Spells</strong> in that they use <strong>Mind Dice</strong> to be played, but their focus is less on general havoc and more on altering a specific target or group of targets. Remember that an <strong>Enchantment</strong> is not always an <strong>Enhancement</strong>; it simply means that a change is underway, which is not always beneficial for the target. The<strong> Enchantment Card</strong> melds with the target to enhance or break down their physical being. Many <strong>Enchantments</strong> focus on allowing your <strong>Homunculus</strong> or <strong>Minions</strong> to be positively augmented but there are also plenty of Enchantments to be used to negatively affect an enemy <strong>Homunculus</strong>, <strong>Minion</strong>, or even <strong>Monsters</strong>.</p>

        <p>Minion Cards are summoned to the battlefield using the Body Dice of the Homunculus. These cards create sentient beings in the Afterlife. Think of playing these cards as your Homunculus extending its own physical presence into the new minion.  As such, the transmutation of its Body into the new being can only occur on an adjacent hex.</p>
