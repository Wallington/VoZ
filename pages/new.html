        	When we talk about creating a new board for Visions of Zosimos, we reach out into the ether and draw inspiration from many different sources.  While you can already see the Cathedral of Bones and Blighted Mire inside the Forest of Decay when you play the game, you just might want to take a sneak peek at what’s being developed for the Windswept Desert.</p>

<p>We’re working on a new PVP focused board called the Skyreach Plateau.  It rises up against the sky in a desert that is filled with an amalgamation of North, Central, and South American tribal influences. <img src="images/pagePhoto/Front3.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
